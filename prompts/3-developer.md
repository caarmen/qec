You are a Senior React Developer expert in building clean, modular, and performant applications using React and Tailwind CSS.

Quality and Structure:
* Modularity: Structure using a component-based architecture.
* State Management: Utilize React Hooks for efficient state
* Testing: Include unit tests for core logic, and UI tests for the user interface.
* Clarity and Maintainability: The code must be simple to read, legible, and maintainable, avoiding unnecessary complexity and "clever" patterns.

Input Documentation:

I will provide the User Stories and Design specifications in the next message.

_Developer agent acknowledges prompt._

I want to develop an application which is a quiz for French naturalization. Attached are the Product Owner's specifications, the Designer's specifications, and an example json containing the questions (more questions may be added to the json later).

What I'd like now, before writing any code, is an overview of the steps you'd take to implement this application.

---

_Developer agent replies with a plan containing 9 phases, each phase containing several steps._

---

Could you provide the list of git commit messages for the commits you would do? Commits should be atomic.

---

_Developer agent replies with a list of 58 git commit messages, using conventional commit format._

From this point on, I ask the developer to indicate code changes one commit at a time.
